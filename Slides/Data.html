### A perennially newsworthy question: how much political violence is there in the U.S., and what are its sources?

---

You can use R for free without installing anything at [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).

In the first attack, which occurred at 8:46 am local time, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center Complex in New York City, New York. Five hijackers belonging to Al-Qaida took control of the Boeing 767 aircraft on a flight originating from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, and destined for Los Angeles International Airport. There were 76 passengers, 11 crew members and five hijackers on the plane, all of whom died upon impact. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m. local time after the South Tower had collapsed at 9:59 a.m. local time. At least 2,770 people died as a result of the attacks in New York City, including 10 hijackers as well as responders who contracted cancer and respiratory illnesses at the attack site and passed away years later. More than 21,000 others were injured, according to information reported by the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund. Al-Qaida leaders including Osama bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attacks in multiple videotaped interviews.

## 1 The attackers reportedly gained control of the plane using sharp objects resembling knives or other sharpened metal objects. The attackers turned the airplane into a missile when flying it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center Complex. The airplane's jet fuel ignited the building and resulted in a massive fire that contributed to the collapse of the North Tower. Mace may have also been used in subduing the passengers and crew members.

## 1 The crash resulted in the destruction of an American Airlines Boeing 767 aircraft. All personal belongings stowed on the plane were destroyed as well. Also destroyed was the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in New York City, which collapsed as a result of the impact and subsequent fire. The building's collapse undoubtedly damaged the foundation of nearby buildings, though the South Tower had already fallen. Businesses located in the North Tower suffered massive economic losses. Air travel was restricted or prevented in the United States for several months following the attacks. Total losses to the United States Airline industry are unknown, but extremely high. Several major United States airlines were nearly bankrupted in the aftermath of the attacks. The attacks had a negative impact on the U.S. and world economy.

Three people including two attendants, Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui, were stabbed or had their throats slashed by the hijackers. American Airlines Flight 11 departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 7:59 am local time. The 9/11 Commission estimated that the hijacking began at 8:14 am. Since the aircraft crashed into the North Tower at 8:46 am, the hijacking lasted 32 minutes. Details on the number of people wounded in the attacks are very difficult to confirm The numbers reported in the GTD are conservative estimates for immediate casualties, first responders, and residents, based on documentation for the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund (VCF).
## 2 This attack was one of four related incidents (cf. 200109110004-07). Flight attendant, Robert Fangman, called a United Airlines office in San Francisco and spoke with Marc Policastro. He reported the hijacking and said that both pilots had been killed. He also reported that a flight attendant was stabbed and said that the hijackers were flying the plane. United Flight 175 departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 8:14 am local time. At 8:47 am, air traffic control received the first indications that the plane was hijacked. Since the airplane impacted the South Tower at 9:03 am, the length of the hijacking was at least 16 minutes. The second aircraft seized was United Airlines flight 175, which was scheduled to depart from Logan at 8:00 and fly directly to Los Angeles. Details on the number of people wounded in the attacks are very difficult to confirm The numbers reported in the GTD are conservative estimates for immediate casualties, first responders, and residents, based on documentation for the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund (VCF).

### Conclusions

1. Consider the perspective and limitations of data sources.

2. Quantitative data are often easier to work with than qualitative data, but may be less rewarding.

3. With enough work, it's usually possible to find or create data to learn an answer to your question.
