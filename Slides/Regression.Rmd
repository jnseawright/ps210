### Regression Analysis

-   Regression analysis is a tool that fits a line to a scatter plot.

 definition
The algebraic formula for a line is: $Y = mX + b$.



---
### Regression Analysis

-   How do we get numbers for $m$ and $b$ in regression analysis?

-   Calculus


---
### Regression Analysis

When we pivot from geometry to regression, two important changes!

1.  Instead of $m$ usually call the slope $\beta$ or $b$, and instead of
    $b$ we usually call the intercept $\alpha$, $a$, or sometimes
    $\beta_0$.

2.  We add a term at the end of the equation for error/noise above and
    below the line. This term is called $e_i$ or $\epsilon_i$.

### Measures of Uncertainty in Regression

-   It sometimes turns out to be reasonable to assume that the sampling
    distribution for estimates of slopes from regression analysis is the
    normal distribution.

-   Computer software that does regression analysis for us will also
    spit out standard errors for the slopes.

### Confounding Variables in Regression

Suppose I know in advance that being a Republican causes people to be 2
points more pro-business/anti-environmental-regulation than being a
Democrat. Can I use that knowledge to get rid of partisanship as a
confounder?


---
$BusEnv_i - b_2 Partisanship_i = a + b_1 TransRights_i + e_i$


---
$BusEnv_i  = a + b_1 TransRights_i + b_2 Partisanship_i + e_i$

### So\...

-   If some assumptions are reasonable and the number of cases is large,
    we can compute a confidence interval around the regression slope.

-   Under just the right circumstances, we can deal with confounding
    variables by adding them to an analysis.


---
### Regression for Prediction


---
### Regression for Prediction

-   If we know a case's scores on all the independent variables in a
    regression, we can make a prediction:

    -   Multiply each score by its variable's coefficient estimate.

    -   Add all of the products together.

    -   Don't forget to add in the intercept.

---
-   The mean homicide rate is 4.1.

-   The S.D. of homicide rates is 7.2.

-   The U.S. homicide rate in 2016 was 6.8.
