### Stages of Survey Research

-   Select a set of individuals to answer the survey.

-   Ask each individual a set of pre-selected questions.

-   Analyze the results.


---
### Define the Population


---
### Choose a Sampling Rule

-   Sometimes we can study all of the cases in a population.

-   Sometimes we need to focus more narrowly.

    -   We need a systematic way of deciding which cases to focus on ---
        a **sampling rule**.

    -   We hope that our sampling rule will give us correct results: we
        want our samples to be like the population.


---
### Samples of Convenience

A **sample of convenience** is a sampling rule where the researchers
simply select the cases that are easily available.



---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/conveniencesample.jpg")
```

---

In October of 2016, news began to circulate online that the major
polling firms were producing badly biased results.


---

Bill O'Reilly contributed to this conversation, according to various
online news sources, by hiring graduate students to "call 250 people
from each party's voting rolls in all 50 states."


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/oreillypoll.jpg")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/trumpvoterfraud.jpg")
```

---
But, oops, O'Reilly never actually hired anyone to do a giant telephone
survey.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/oreillywebpoll.jpg")
```

---
### Quota Sampling

A **quota sample** is where the researchers modify a sample of
convenience by making sure the sample is like the population in
specific, predetermined ways.


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/deweydefeatstruman.jpg")
```

---
### Random Sampling

A **random sample** is a sample where each case has a known probability
of selection.

---
### Random Sampling

The *law of large numbers* tells us that, with a large enough sample, random
sampling basically guarantees that our sample will be like the
population.

---
### Random Sampling

Kinds of random samples:

-   Simple random sample.

-   Cluster sample.

-   Stratified random sample.

---
### What Can Go Wrong?

Non-response; some people just don't want to participate in surveys.

-   Non-response is usually non-random, which means that it spoils most
    of our random samples.

-   What can we do to deal with non-response?


---
### The New World

Response rates have basically collapsed in surveys in much of the world.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}

```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/Stantcheva4.png")
```

### What about 2016 and 2020?


---
### Was 2016 a Polling Miss?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/surveys2016.png")
```

---
### Was 2016 a Polling Miss?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/fivethirtyeight2016.png")
```

### Was 2016 a Polling Miss?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/reuters2016.png")
```

---
### Was 2020 a Polling Miss?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/surveys2020.png")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}

How much does question wording matter?

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/Bruinsma1.png")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/Bruinsma2.png")
```

---

There's no way to generate a perfectly neutral survey question, but the key is to
ask things as simply as possible.
