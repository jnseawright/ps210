# Basic Course Information

This course provides an introduction to the empirical methods political
scientists use to answer questions about politics, and the reasons why
such methods matter. After exploring how hard it is to make good
descriptive and causal inferences about politics, we will examine three
basic strategies for overcoming the obstacles to reliable knowledge
about the political world: experimentation, large N or quantitative
studies (AKA statistics), and small N studies that use qualitative
reasoning.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Understand and explain why descriptive and causal inference are
    difficult tasks in political science.

-   Identify possible weaknesses in academic or other descriptive and
    causal claims about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of experimental
    research designs for causal inference about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of survey and
    regression-based quantitative research designs for descriptive and
    causal inference about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative
    methods for descriptive and causal inference about politics.

-   Apply all of these tools to critically evaluating examples of
    political science research.

-   Think about how empirical evidence matters to your own questions
    about politics.

Grades will be based on three homework assignments (30% total), a
midterm (30% total), a final exam (30%), and participation (10%).
Homework due dates will be set throughout the quarter. Students are
encouraged to form study groups and work together but must complete and
submit their own homework.

Late work will be accepted but with a grade penalty equivalent to 5% per day. Late exams will not be accepted without prior communication with the instructors or an overriding exemption due to university policy.

While some of the tools discussed in this course are based in
sophisticated mathematical reasoning, our discussion of them will be
posed at a primarily conceptual level. Hence, no particular mathematical
or statistical background is expected for this course.

The textbook for this course, available for free online, is *Empirical
Methods in Political Science: An introduction*, edited by Jean
Clipperton. That text can be found at [the library's
github](https://nulib-oer.github.io/empirical-methods-polisci/). The
textbook will be supplemented as needed with other readings available
electronically.

# Research Study Participation Requirement

Students enrolled in this course are required to complete a research participation assignment. This will involve taking part in studies conducted by students and faculty from the Department of Political Science, and will include up to 4 hours of research study participation. This will primarily require completing on-line surveys, and in some cases in-person studies at Scott Hall. Students will be able to see how political science studies are conducted and can request information about the studies at the end of the quarter. Students who prefer not to participate in research may opt for an alternative that entails reading a book chapter about political science research and writing a five page reaction paper. The typical chapter is about 20 pages and thus reading it and writing a five-page paper should take approximately four hours. In order to opt for the 5-page paper alternative, please email the lab manager, Jacob Fortier at jacobfortier2027@u.northwestern.edu.

# Northwestern University Syllabus Standards

Activity: for a research question in the social sciences that interests you, suggest a design for an experiment that could be done as an honors thesis project. (You don't have to actually intend to do it, etc., but it has to be the kind of thing that could hypothetically be done.) Explain why you find the topic interesting and how your design helps answer your question. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your design in comparison with the example experiments linked above.

Please email your responses to the activity (which shouldn't be more than a couple of pages double-spaced) to Professor Seawright!
