# Basic Course Information

This course provides an introduction to the empirical methods political
scientists use to answer questions about politics, and the reasons why
such methods matter. After exploring how hard it is to make good
descriptive and causal inferences about politics, we will examine three
basic strategies for overcoming the obstacles to reliable knowledge
about the political world: experimentation, large N or quantitative
studies (AKA statistics), and small N studies that use qualitative
reasoning.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Understand and explain why descriptive and causal inference are
    difficult tasks in political science.

-   Identify possible weaknesses in academic or other descriptive and
    causal claims about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of experimental
    research designs for causal inference about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of survey and
    regression-based quantitative research designs for descriptive and
    causal inference about politics.

-   Understand and explain the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative
    methods for descriptive and causal inference about politics.

-   Apply all of these tools to critically evaluating examples of
    political science research.

-   Think about how empirical evidence matters to your own questions
    about politics.

Grades will be based on three homework assignments (30% total), a
midterm (30% total), a final exam (30%), and participation (10%).
Homework due dates will be set throughout the quarter. Students are
encouraged to form study groups and work together but must complete and
submit their own homework.

-   October 17th: First homework due.

-   October 21st: Take-home midterm due.

-   November 14th: Second homework due.

-   November 21th: Zoom session to support Thanksgiving travel.

-   November 21st: Third homework due.

-   Monday, December 4th, 2:00 PM: Take-home final exam due.

You are required to complete a research assignment that can include up
to 4 hours of research study participation. These studies require that
students set up an appointment to complete participation at a laboratory
on campus (or via an on-line survey). You will learn how studies are
conducted and will receive a synopsis at the conclusion of the quarter
describing the study's goal, result, and relevance to the class. If you
prefer not to participate in research as a subject, you may opt for an
alternative that entails reading one chapter about political science
research and writing a five page reaction paper. The typical chapter is
about 20 pages and thus reading it and writing a five page paper should
take approximately four hours.

During the first week of the quarter, you will receive an e-mail asking
you whether you prefer study participation or the alternative
assignment. The e-mail will also include details on how to complete
either requirement. Failure to complete the requirement during the
quarter will result in an incomplete. Failure to complete the
requirement during the following quarter will result in a failing grade
for the class. Note that if you are enrolled in multiple classes that
require participation, you only need to satisfy the requirement one
time. Also, if you already completed the requirement in another course
in a previous quarter, you are excused from the requirement.

While some of the tools discussed in this course are based in
sophisticated mathematical reasoning, our discussion of them will be
posed at a primarily conceptual level. Hence, no particular mathematical
or statistical background is expected for this course.

One choice for the textbook for this course is *The Fundamentals of
Political Science Research*, 3rd edition, written by Paul M. Kellstedt
and Guy D. Whitten. A second option, available online, is *Empirical
Methods in Political Science: An introduction*, edited by Jean
Clipperton. That text can be found at [the library's
github](https://nulib-oer.github.io/empirical-methods-polisci/). These
textbooks will be supplemented as needed with other readings available
electronically, either linked in this syllabus or found in the Readings
folder of the course Canvas site. You are free to read these materials
either before or after class, as works best for your study process,
unless we ask you otherwise in special preparation for a particular
class session.
